      First of all we have to agree to cover all the steps that are in our power
      to ensure security of the website. We will do that with practises that are
      proven efficient, among which are: ensuring that the data that is accepted
      by system is in the right format. After that we have to ensure
      authorization and authentication are hard to crack. As well important is
      to ensure that a third party application is trusted and tested. We also
      have to take in consideration users that leave their credentials in the
      browser long. A lot can be done manualy, but there are also some
      well-known third-party that provide secure help in this actions, which can
      make sure that nothing is overseen, and we are more than happy to use
      them.
